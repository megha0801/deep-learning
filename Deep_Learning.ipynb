Inside this class, the `__init__()` method is used to define the layers of the network, such as fully connected layers using `nn.Linear`. The forward pass, which describes how input data flows through the layers, is defined in the `forward()` method, using activation functions like ReLU or Sigmoid. After defining the model, you create an instance of it and then set up a loss function (e.g., binary cross-entropy using `nn.BCELoss`) and an optimizer (like `torch.optim.Adam`) to update the model's weights during training. The training loop typically involves feeding inputs through the model, computing the loss, zeroing the gradients, performing backpropagation with `loss.backward()`, and updating the model's parameters with `optimizer.step()`. This structure makes PyTorch flexible and intuitive, especially for researchers and developers working on custom deep learning models.\n"

        "In neural networks, activation functions play a crucial role by introducing non-linearity, which allows the model to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data. One of the most widely used activation functions is **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**, which outputs the input directly if it is positive, otherwise returns zero. ReLU is popular for its simplicity and effectiveness in deep networks, although it can lead to the \"dying ReLU\" problem where some neurons become inactive. Another common function is the **Sigmoid**, which maps input values into a range between 0 and 1, making it suitable for binary classification tasks. However, it can suffer from vanishing gradients during training. The **Tanh** function is similar to Sigmoid but outputs values between -1 and 1 and is zero-centered, which often helps optimization, though it also faces gradient issues in deeper networks.\n",

        "**Leaky ReLU** is a modified version of ReLU that allows a small, non-zero gradient when the input is negative, addressing the dying ReLU issue. For multi-class classification problems, the **Softmax** function is typically used in the output layer, converting raw scores into probabilities that sum to one. Lastly, newer functions like **Swish**, developed by Google, have shown better performance in some deep models by combining properties of ReLU and Sigmoid. Overall, the choice of activation function significantly impacts model performance and convergence behavior.\n"

It is ideal when you need to build complex models with custom forward passes, conditional logic, loops, or multiple branches. You define the model's layers in the `__init__` method and explicitly implement how data flows through those layers in the `forward()` method. This makes `nn.Module` suitable for advanced tasks like recurrent networks, attention mechanisms, or models with skip connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, `torch.nn.Sequential` is a high-level utility that simplifies model creation when the architecture is a simple, straight stack of layers. It automatically handles the forward pass by applying each layer in order, so you don’t have to write a separate `forward()` method. This makes it a quick and clean choice for building basic feedforward networks or prototypes. However, it lacks the flexibility needed for non-linear or more sophisticated models. In summary, use `nn.Sequential` for simple linear pipelines, and opt for `nn.Module` when you need full control over the model's behavior.\n"

Using TensorFlow’s integrated Keras API, you can easily load and preprocess the dataset, normalize pixel values, and construct a CNN model using layers like `Conv2D`, `MaxPooling2D`, `Flatten`, and `Dense`. The model is compiled with an optimizer such as Adam, a suitable loss function like sparse categorical cross-entropy, and accuracy as the evaluation metric. After training the model over several epochs using the `model.fit()` function, its performance can be evaluated on a test set using `model.evaluate()`.

Instead of training a model from scratch, which requires massive data and compute power, you can **fine-tune** or adapt a pre-trained model to your specific task (like image classification, object detection, or text analysis) using a smaller dataset. This not only accelerates development but also improves performance, especially when labeled data is limited.
